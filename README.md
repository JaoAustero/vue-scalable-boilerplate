## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why would I use this boilerplate instead of generating a new project with [Vue CLI] (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) or the popular [Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate)?**

The boilerplate was designed for scalable projects based on the experiments and experience of myself. The Vue CLI
asims for flexbility, making it as simple as possible for any team. This will aim to make your code modular
or breaking into pieces to make it modular, reusable and clean.

I was follower of [Chris Frits](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/) based on his amazing works, some of the
setup in this boilerplate is similar to his [Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate). The difference was the developers preference and how to keep your file
clean and simple.

**What is the difference between this Boilerplate to [Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate)?**

I aim to make the architecture possible for scalability of the project and make it modular that you can separate
by pieces like Lego. This will be update and evolve based on the contributors, sponsors or any developers
suggestion that would make the this boilerplate for better architecture.

**Can you build a Nuext version of boilerplate?**
I have a plan for this one to consider non-spa versions.
